      <item value="I got such error after a simple try of code refactoring. It has happened nor after some library was connected neither any changes in gradle. It looked like something in my code was wrong but the compiler could not found the issue. That's why I double checked all changes that I did and found that I had changed somehow method signature in the interface but had not changed it in class that implements it. I got this error twice during one day and decided to share my experience. I hope that it is a temporary compiler bug.&#10;&#10;Solution 1 Possible solution is to go to File -&gt; Settings -&gt; Compiler -&gt; and add &quot;--stacktrace --debug&quot; to Command-line Options. Read log and try to found the answer of what went wrong.&#10;&#10;In new Android Studio 3.1.+, you can enable/disable console log details by pressing &quot;Toggle View&quot; on &quot;Build&quot; tab. There you can find the details. Pay attention that both modes can be useful for investigation of the problem's reason. See: https://stackoverflow.com/a/49717363/" />
