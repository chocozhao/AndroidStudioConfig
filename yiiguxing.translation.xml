      <item value=" About Vitrite ------------- Vitrite is a tiny utility for Windows 2000 (or newer) that allows you  to adjust the transparency of almost any visible window. Just click on  the window you wish to modify and then press:   Ctrl + Shift + [Any numerical key on the top row of your keyboard]  There are 10 different levels of transparency:   1 == Most transparent   [...]   9 == Least transparent   0 == No transparency  It's really pretty straightforward.  Another feature of Vitrite is the ability to toggle a window's &quot;always  on top&quot; flag. Just press &quot;Ctrl Shift +&quot; (that's the plus sign) and it  will make the active window stay on top of the other windows. Press it again to reverse this behavior.   Who Wrote This -------------- Author: Ryan VanMiddlesworth Email: ryanvm@insightbb.com (Although it changes all the time) Environment: Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Using Visual C) Other Projects:   batemail (http://batemail.sourceforge.net)     Installation ------------ There are two different versions of Vitrite: Self-Extracting Install and  Zipped Release. For the self-extracting version you just let it run. For  the zipped version you unzip the files into any directory you want and  you're good to go. You'll probably want to create a shortcut to it in  the 'Start Menu'. [Hint: Put it in the 'Startup' group if you want it to  start every time you turn on your computer.]  Note: I would have distributed it as a single EXE; however, the mechanism  used for intercepting keyboard messages requires the use of a DLL. It's no  biggie though, you don't need to put in in your system directory or any- thing. Just make sure the DLL and the EXE are in the same directory.   Availability ------------ Vitrite is released under the GNU General Public License. You can find  the actual license in the file named 'GPL.TXT'. I would explain it, but if you're clever enough to be looking for the source code then you probably already know. If not go to http://www.fsf.org.  If you'd like to have the source code but don't want to play by the GPL  rules, you have two choices:  * Disregard the license and do whatever you want with the source code.     Unfortunately, if you do this you'll go to Hell.  * Or you can contact me and I'll sell you a copy of the source code     under the less-restrictive BSD license. [Disclaimer: Use of this option     does not guarantee that you don't go to hell; but at least it won't be     because you stole my source code.]  You can reach me at ryanvm@insightbb.com or whatever email address is  listed for me at http://batemail.sourceforge.net.
